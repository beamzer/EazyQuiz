## üìù Creating Quiz Files

### JSON Format (Recommended)

The JSON format offers the most flexibility and is the easiest to create:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Question Category",
    "question": "What is your question?",
    "options": [
      "A) First option",
      "B) Second option", 
      "C) Third option",
      "D) Fourth option"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Detailed explanation with **markdown** support..."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Another Question",
    "question": "Next question text?",
    "options": [
      "A) Option 1",
      "B) Option 2"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Another detailed explanation..."
  }
]
```

### XML Format

Well-structured XML format for those who prefer markup:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<quiz>
  <question id="1">
    <title>Question Category</title>
    <text>What is your question?</text>
    <options>
      <option key="A">First option</option>
      <option key="B">Second option</option>
      <option key="C">Third option</option>
      <option key="D">Fourth option</option>
    </options>
    <correct>A</correct>
    <explanation>Detailed explanation here...</explanation>
  </question>
</quiz>
```

### TXT Format (Simplest)

Plain text format with simple delimiters:

```
TITLE: Question Category
QUESTION: What is your question?
A) First option
B) Second option
C) Third option
D) Fourth option
CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: Detailed explanation here...
---
TITLE: Next Question Category
QUESTION: Another question?
A) Option 1
B) Option 2
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: Another explanation...
```
