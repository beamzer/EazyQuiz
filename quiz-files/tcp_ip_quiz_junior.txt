# Quiz File Generation for TCP/IP - Junior IT Administrator Level

TITLE: TCP/IP Fundamentals for IT Administrators

QUESTION: What are the four layers of the TCP/IP model, listed from top to bottom?
A) Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport
B) Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access
C) Session, Presentation, Application, Transport
D) Network, Internet, Transport, Application
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access (from top to bottom) [RFC 1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122). 
**=>** The Application layer includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP that end users interact with directly 
**=>** The Transport layer (TCP/UDP) provides reliable or unreliable data delivery between applications 
**=>** The Internet layer (IP) handles routing between networks, while the Network Access layer manages the physical transmission of data over network media.

QUESTION: What is the default subnet mask for a Class B IP address?
A) 255.0.0.0
B) 255.255.0.0
C) 255.255.255.0
D) 255.255.255.255
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: Class B networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 (/16 in CIDR notation), which provides 16 bits for the network portion and 16 bits for host addresses [RFC 950](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc950). 
**=>** This allows for 65,534 host addresses per Class B network (2^16 - 2, subtracting network and broadcast addresses) 
**=>** Class B addresses range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255, making them suitable for medium to large organizations 
**=>** While classful addressing is largely obsolete due to CIDR, understanding these concepts helps with legacy network configurations and subnetting fundamentals.

QUESTION: Which port number does HTTP use by default, and what transport protocol does it run on?
A) Port 80, UDP
B) Port 443, TCP
C) Port 80, TCP
D) Port 8080, UDP
CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) uses port 80 by default and runs on TCP as its transport protocol [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616). 
**=>** TCP is used because HTTP requires reliable, ordered delivery of data to ensure web pages load correctly and completely 
**=>** Port 443 is used for HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which adds SSL/TLS encryption to HTTP communications 
**=>** As an IT administrator, you'll commonly see port 80 traffic in firewall rules and network monitoring tools when managing web server access.

QUESTION: What command would you use in Windows to display the current IP configuration of all network adapters?
A) ping localhost
B) ipconfig /all
C) netstat -a
D) tracert 8.8.8.8
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The `ipconfig /all` command displays comprehensive IP configuration information for all network adapters on a Windows system [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ipconfig). 
**=>** This includes IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, DHCP lease information, and MAC addresses 
**=>** The basic `ipconfig` command shows only IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for active adapters 
**=>** This is one of the most essential troubleshooting commands for IT administrators when diagnosing network connectivity issues.

QUESTION: What is the purpose of a default gateway in IP networking?
A) To assign IP addresses to devices automatically
B) To provide a path for traffic destined to networks outside the local subnet
C) To resolve domain names to IP addresses
D) To encrypt network traffic for security
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: A default gateway provides a route for network traffic that is destined for IP addresses outside the local subnet, typically pointing to a router that connects to other networks [Cisco Networking Basics](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html). 
**=>** When a device needs to communicate with an IP address not on its local network, it forwards the packet to the default gateway 
**=>** Without a properly configured default gateway, devices can only communicate with other devices on the same local subnet 
**=>** IT administrators must ensure all network devices have the correct default gateway configured, either manually or through DHCP, to enable internet and inter-network communication.

QUESTION: Which of the following IP addresses is a private (non-routable) address according to RFC 1918?
A) 8.8.8.8
B) 172.16.50.100
C) 203.0.113.5
D) 224.0.0.1
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The IP address 172.16.50.100 falls within the private address range 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 as defined in RFC 1918 [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918). 
**=>** Private IP addresses are not routed on the public internet and are reserved for internal network use within organizations 
**=>** The three private address ranges are: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 
**=>** IT administrators use these addresses for internal networks and rely on NAT (Network Address Translation) to enable internet access for devices using private addresses.

QUESTION: What does DNS stand for, and what is its primary function?
A) Dynamic Network Service - automatically assigns IP addresses
B) Domain Name System - translates domain names to IP addresses
C) Data Network Security - encrypts network communications
D) Distributed Network Storage - provides file sharing capabilities
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical naming system that translates human-readable domain names like www.google.com into IP addresses that computers use for communication [RFC 1034](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034). 
**=>** Without DNS, users would need to memorize IP addresses like 142.250.191.14 instead of simply typing google.com 
**=>** DNS operates on port 53 and uses both UDP for standard queries and TCP for zone transfers and large responses 
**=>** IT administrators must configure DNS servers correctly on all network devices to ensure proper name resolution for web browsing, email, and other network services.

QUESTION: What is the difference between TCP and UDP protocols?
A) TCP is faster, UDP is more reliable
B) TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, UDP is connectionless and unreliable
C) TCP uses port numbers, UDP does not
D) TCP is for internet traffic, UDP is for local network traffic only
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented and provides reliable, ordered delivery with error checking, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and provides fast but unreliable delivery [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) and [RFC 768](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768). 
**=>** TCP establishes a connection before data transfer and guarantees that all data arrives in the correct order, making it suitable for web browsing, email, and file transfers 
**=>** UDP sends data without establishing a connection and doesn't guarantee delivery, making it ideal for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and DNS queries where speed is more important than perfect reliability 
**=>** Both protocols use port numbers to identify specific applications and services on a device.

QUESTION: What tool would you use to test network connectivity between your computer and a remote server?
A) ipconfig
B) ping
C) netstat
D) nslookup
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The ping command tests basic network connectivity between your computer and a remote host by sending ICMP Echo Request packets and measuring the response time [RFC 792](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792). 
**=>** A successful ping shows that the network path is functional and provides round-trip time measurements that help identify latency issues 
**=>** Ping is available on virtually all operating systems and is typically the first diagnostic tool IT administrators use when troubleshooting connectivity problems 
**=>** While ping tests basic reachability, it may not work if ICMP traffic is blocked by firewalls, so additional testing with tools like telnet or traceroute might be necessary.

QUESTION: What does DHCP stand for, and what is its main purpose in a network?
A) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - automatically assigns IP addresses to devices
B) Distributed Hardware Control Protocol - manages network equipment remotely
C) Data Handling and Control Protocol - manages file transfers
D) Digital Host Communication Protocol - encrypts network traffic
CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network [RFC 2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131). 
**=>** This eliminates the need for IT administrators to manually configure IP settings on every device, reducing configuration errors and simplifying network management 
**=>** DHCP servers maintain a pool of available IP addresses and lease them to clients for a specified period, automatically renewing or reclaiming addresses as needed 
**=>** DHCP also provides additional configuration options like DNS server addresses, domain names, and time servers, making it essential for automated network administration in modern environments.
