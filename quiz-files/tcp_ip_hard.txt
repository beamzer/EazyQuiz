QUESTION: What is the maximum segment size (MSS) that TCP can negotiate during the three-way handshake, and how is it determined?
A) Fixed at 1460 bytes based on Ethernet MTU
B) Dynamically calculated as MTU minus IP and TCP header sizes
C) Always set to 65,535 bytes (maximum TCP window size)
D) Configured manually by the network administrator
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is dynamically negotiated during TCP's three-way handshake and is calculated as the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) minus the IP header (20 bytes) and TCP header (20 bytes minimum) [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793). 
**=>** For standard Ethernet with MTU 1500 bytes, this results in MSS of 1460 bytes, but this can vary based on the underlying network technology 
**=>** Both endpoints advertise their MSS in the SYN packets, and each side uses the smaller of the two values to avoid fragmentation 
**=>** Modern implementations also support MSS discovery mechanisms to optimize performance across different network paths.

QUESTION: In TCP congestion control, what happens during the "fast recovery" phase of the TCP Reno algorithm?
A) The congestion window is reset to 1 MSS and slow start begins
B) The congestion window is halved and linear increase continues
C) The transmission rate is immediately doubled
D) All outstanding packets are retransmitted
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: During TCP Reno's fast recovery phase, the congestion window (cwnd) is set to half of its previous value plus 3 MSS, and the algorithm continues with linear increase rather than exponential slow start [RFC 5681](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681). 
**=>** This phase is triggered when three duplicate ACKs are received, indicating a likely single packet loss rather than network congestion 
**=>** Fast recovery allows TCP to maintain higher throughput by avoiding the dramatic reduction to 1 MSS that occurs with timeout-based recovery 
**=>** The algorithm inflates the congestion window for each additional duplicate ACK received, then deflates it when the retransmitted segment is acknowledged.

QUESTION: What is the primary difference between IPv4 fragmentation and IPv6 fragmentation handling?
A) IPv6 uses smaller fragment sizes for better efficiency
B) IPv4 allows intermediate routers to fragment, IPv6 only allows source fragmentation
C) IPv6 fragments are reassembled at each hop, IPv4 only at destination
D) IPv4 supports fragmentation, IPv6 does not support fragmentation at all
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: IPv4 allows any intermediate router along the path to fragment packets if they exceed the link MTU, while IPv6 only permits fragmentation at the source host [RFC 8200](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200). 
**=>** IPv6 routers that encounter packets larger than the next-hop MTU will drop the packet and send an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message back to the source 
**=>** This design decision in IPv6 improves router performance by eliminating fragmentation processing overhead and encourages proper Path MTU Discovery 
**=>** Both protocols reassemble fragments only at the final destination, never at intermediate routers.

QUESTION: Which TCP option is used to improve performance over high-bandwidth, high-latency networks by allowing larger window sizes?
A) Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
B) Window Scale Factor
C) Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)
D) Timestamp Option
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The Window Scale Factor option (RFC 7323) allows TCP to advertise window sizes larger than the standard 65,535 bytes by providing a scaling factor that can multiply the window size by up to 2^14 [RFC 7323](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7323). 
**=>** This is crucial for high-bandwidth delay product networks where the standard 64KB window would severely limit throughput 
**=>** The scaling factor is negotiated during the initial three-way handshake and remains constant for the entire connection 
**=>** Without window scaling, a 1 Gbps connection with 100ms RTT would be limited to approximately 5.2 Mbps throughput due to window size constraints.

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the TCP sequence number field, and how many bytes does it occupy in the TCP header?
A) 2 bytes, used for packet ordering and duplicate detection
B) 4 bytes, used for reliable delivery and flow control
C) 8 bytes, used for connection identification
D) 4 bytes, used only for initial connection establishment
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The TCP sequence number field occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) in the TCP header and serves multiple critical functions including reliable delivery, packet ordering, and flow control [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793). 
**=>** Each byte of data transmitted is assigned a sequence number, allowing the receiver to detect missing, duplicate, or out-of-order segments 
**=>** The sequence number space is 2^32 (approximately 4.3 billion), and numbers wrap around when exhausted, which is handled by TCP's sequence number arithmetic **=>** During connection establishment, both sides choose random initial sequence numbers (ISN) to prevent connection hijacking and ensure uniqueness.

QUESTION: In the context of IP routing, what is the difference between a directly connected route and a static route?
A) Directly connected routes have lower administrative distance
B) Static routes are automatically discovered, directly connected routes are manually configured
C) Directly connected routes are learned from physical interfaces, static routes are manually configured
D) There is no functional difference between them
CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: Directly connected routes are automatically learned when an IP address is configured on an interface and that interface becomes active, while static routes are manually configured by network administrators [Cisco Routing Protocols](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html). 
**=>** Directly connected routes typically have an administrative distance of 0 (most trusted), while static routes usually have an administrative distance of 1 
**=>** Directly connected routes represent networks that are physically attached to the router's interfaces, making them inherently reachable without additional routing decisions 
**=>** Static routes provide manual control over routing decisions and are often used for default routes, backup paths, or routing to networks not covered by dynamic routing protocols.

QUESTION: What mechanism does TCP use to detect and recover from packet loss, and how does it differentiate between network congestion and random packet loss?
A) Only timeout-based retransmission with exponential backoff
B) Duplicate ACKs for fast retransmit and timeout for congestion detection
C) ICMP error messages from intermediate routers
D) Periodic keep-alive messages to test connectivity
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: TCP uses duplicate ACKs to trigger fast retransmit (typically after 3 duplicate ACKs) for quick loss recovery, while timeout events are interpreted as signs of severe congestion requiring more aggressive response [RFC 5681](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681). 
**=>** Fast retransmit assumes random packet loss and maintains higher congestion window values, while timeout-based recovery assumes network congestion and reduces the window to 1 MSS 
**=>** Modern TCP implementations also use Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) to provide more detailed information about which segments have been received successfully **=>** The distinction between these mechanisms allows TCP to maintain higher performance during random loss while still responding appropriately to actual network congestion.

QUESTION: What is the primary purpose of the IPv4 Time to Live (TTL) field and its IPv6 equivalent Hop Limit field?
A) To measure network latency between source and destination
B) To prevent infinite routing loops by limiting packet lifetime
C) To prioritize packets based on urgency
D) To enable multicast routing functionality
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The TTL field in IPv4 and Hop Limit field in IPv6 prevent infinite routing loops by ensuring packets are discarded after traversing a maximum number of routers [RFC 791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791) and [RFC 8200](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200). 
**=>** Each router decrements this value by 1 when forwarding the packet, and if it reaches 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source 
**=>** This mechanism is essential for network stability, as routing loops could otherwise cause packets to circulate indefinitely, consuming bandwidth and router resources 
**=>** The field is also utilized by diagnostic tools like traceroute, which deliberately sets increasing TTL values to map network paths.

QUESTION: How does TCP's Nagle algorithm affect network performance, and when might you want to disable it?
A) It always improves performance by reducing packet overhead
B) It reduces small packet transmission but may increase latency for interactive applications
C) It only affects UDP traffic, not TCP
D) It increases bandwidth utilization by sending larger packets more frequently
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: Nagle's algorithm reduces network overhead by preventing the transmission of small TCP segments when there are outstanding unacknowledged data, but this can increase latency for interactive applications [RFC 896](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc896). 
**=>** The algorithm states that only one small segment can be outstanding at a time, forcing applications to wait for ACKs before sending additional small packets 
**=>** This is beneficial for applications like telnet that generate many single-character packets, but problematic for real-time applications like gaming or VoIP where low latency is critical 
**=>** The TCP_NODELAY socket option can disable Nagle's algorithm when immediate transmission of small packets is more important than bandwidth efficiency.

QUESTION: What is the significance of the TCP window size in flow control, and how does it interact with the receiver's buffer space?
A) Window size is fixed at connection establishment and never changes
B) Window size advertises available buffer space and controls sender transmission rate
C) Window size only affects congestion control, not flow control
D) Window size is determined solely by network bandwidth
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The TCP window size field advertises the amount of available buffer space at the receiver and directly controls how much data the sender can transmit without receiving an acknowledgment [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793). 
**=>** As the receiver's application consumes data from the buffer, the available window space increases and is advertised in subsequent ACK packets 
**=>** If the receiver's buffer becomes full, it advertises a window size of zero, causing the sender to stop transmission until buffer space becomes available 
**=>** This sliding window mechanism provides end-to-end flow control that prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers, working independently of network congestion control mechanisms.
