TITLE: Malware Types
QUESTION: What type of malware is designed to spread automatically across networks without user interaction?
A) Virus
B) Trojan
C) Worm
D) Spyware
CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: A **worm** is a type of malware that can replicate and spread automatically across networks without requiring user interaction or a host program.

**Key characteristics of worms:**

- **Self-replicating**: Creates copies of itself automatically
- **Network propagation**: Spreads across network connections
- **No host required**: Unlike viruses, doesn't need to attach to other programs
- **Autonomous**: Operates independently without user actions

**Famous examples:**
- Morris Worm (1988) - First major internet worm
- ILOVEYOU (2000) - Spread via email
- Conficker (2008) - Infected millions of computers
- WannaCry (2017) - Ransomware worm that caused global disruption

**How worms differ from other malware:**
- **Virus**: Requires host program and user action
- **Trojan**: Disguises itself but doesn't self-replicate
- **Spyware**: Focuses on data collection, not propagation

**Prevention:**
- Keep systems updated with security patches
- Use network segmentation
- Deploy intrusion detection systems
- Maintain updated antivirus software
